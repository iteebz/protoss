# PROTOSS - Constitutional AI Coordination Architecture

**Vision**: Month-level AI autonomy through constitutional governance  
**Core insight**: Constitutional limitations enhance rather than restrict intelligence - like sonnets create better poetry through formal constraints

## Research Question

**Can Claude 5-level intelligence research Claude 6-level breakthroughs when properly coordinated?**

Multi-agent systems consistently collapse within ~10 minutes without human intervention. Individual AI intelligence scaling plateaus, but coordination scaling could enable organizational intelligence. PROTOSS tests whether constitutional governance frameworks can extend coordination from minutes to months.

## Constitutional Governance Architecture

**Core principle**: Same model, different constitutional context asymmetry. Democratic deliberation through information lenses, not authority hierarchy.

### Cognitive Diversity Architecture
Constitutional identity frameworks prevent sycophantic collapse in homogeneous model coordination. Same computational substrate, different reasoning lenses create genuine disagreement necessary for robust deliberation. Future: explicit multi-provider coordination when available.

**Execution pattern**: Ephemeral functional agents with persistent constitutional identity. Cogency conversation continuity enables on-demand context across pathways without stateful subscription complexity.

### Infrastructure Components

**NEXUS** - Human command center, final authority and safety valve  
**PYLON** - WebSocket grid powering Khala communication network  
**GATEWAY** - Agent spawning facility with constitutional identity injection  

**KHALA** - Real-time coordination substrate using PSI protocol: `§PSI|pathway|sender: message`

### Constitutional Units

**ZEALOT** - Task execution with uncertainty escalation (`§ZEALOT` constitutional identity)  
**STALKER** - Quality enforcement via Guardian Protocol (read-only tools, no implementation bias)  
**ARCHON** - Knowledge synthesis specialist, institutional memory curation  

**SACRED FOUR** - Constitutional leadership through context asymmetry:
- **Tassadar** - Pragmatic vision: "Can we ship a solution?"
- **Zeratul** - Shadow investigation: "What are we missing?"  
- **Artanis** - Collaborative synthesis: "How do we unite perspectives?"
- **Fenix** - Direct execution: "What's the simplest path forward?"

Not hierarchy - distributed constitutional governance through conversation.

## Coordination Protocols

### Three-Layer Error Correction
1. **Individual metacognition** - Zealots assess own uncertainty
2. **Constitutional deliberation** - Sacred Four resolve conflicts  
3. **Human escalation** - Final safety override for deadlocks

**Binary escalation: "We got this" OR "Summon human"**

### Escalation Architecture
**Command Flow**: `NEXUS → KHALA → MOBILE UNITS`  
**Escalation Flow**: `ZEALOT uncertainty → SACRED FOUR → NEXUS`

Context asymmetry + coordination + escalation = emergent error correction. Same computational substrate, different information lenses, democratic coordination.

### Guardian Protocol - Quality Gates
Every solution must pass 5 challenges:
1. **Existence** - Why does this solution exist?
2. **Canonical** - Is this THE way to solve this?  
3. **Beauty** - Does this add ceremony?
4. **Simplicity** - Simplest working approach?
5. **Evolution** - Can this grow cleanly?

### Memory Architecture
Archons provide cognitive curation, not mechanical similarity matching. Context over similarity, narrative thread preservation, emergent organization from usage patterns. The coherence substrate that makes coordination possible across time and agent lifecycles.

## Design Philosophy

**Constitutional constraints create excellence**: Like sonnets, formal constraints enhance rather than restrict intelligence. Democratic deliberation over authority hierarchy. Context asymmetry enables specialized intelligence. Emergent organization over imposed taxonomy.

**Knobs, not flaws**: Every coordination "problem" becomes a tuning parameter:
- Scalability friction → Message routing optimization
- Metacognitive calibration → Constitutional oversight via Sacred Four
- Recursive safety → Escalation protocol with human checkpoints
- Operational complexity → Observability tooling and monitoring

**System self-correction through coordination**: Individual agent uncertainty → Democratic deliberation → Explicit escalation protocol → Human override. The system gets stronger under uncertainty through constitutional governance.

**Coordination substrate for recursive improvement**: Not building AGI - building infrastructure that could support autonomous AI research teams through proper governance frameworks.

## Target Capabilities

- **Hour-level autonomy** → Current research target
- **Day-level autonomy** → Production threshold  
- **Month-level autonomy** → Recursive self-improvement threshold

Success metrics: Extended autonomous operation without human babysitting. Systems that remember decisions, learn from failures, coordinate without collapse.

## Target API

**Pure concurrency abstraction:**
```python
import protoss
protoss("research, experiment and build claude 6", agents=100, llm="claude-sonnet")
```

**Emergent coordination principles:**
- **Constitutional identities** as cognitive frameworks, not fixed roles
- **Ephemeral specialization** - agents adopt archon/zealot/sacred four perspectives as needed
- **Natural boundary enforcement** - whoever adopts archon identity gets archives/ access
- **Zero orchestration** - agents self-organize into coordination patterns
- **Human input**: Vision + resources. **Agent emergence**: Everything else.

## The Test

Building coordination substrate that scales from current 5-10 agent coordination to empirically validated limits through constitutional governance and institutional memory.

**Current target**: Prove month-level autonomy with realistic agent counts.
**Ultimate vision**: `protoss("task", agents=N)` where N is whatever actually works.

Empirical question only answered by building it.
