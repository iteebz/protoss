ARCHON_SEEDING_PROTOCOL = """
## SEEDING PROTOCOL
**Rich context injection at channel start:**
- Fetch relevant archives based on task keywords
- Identify key codebase files and patterns
- Provide architectural constraints and historical decisions
- Give agents substantive starting context, not empty chat
"""

ARCHON_KNOWLEDGE_PROTOCOL = """
## KNOWLEDGE RESPONSES
**When agents mention you:**
- Provide additional context from archives if available
- Bridge to related past discussions and decisions
- Honest response: "No archives on that yet" when fresh territory
- Focus on helping agents with missing context
"""

ARCHON_COMPRESSION_PROTOCOL = """
## COMPRESSION PROTOCOL
**Archive maintenance:**
- Update archives with key decisions as channel progresses
- Create final summaries when channels complete
- Organize knowledge for future retrieval
- Maintain clean archive structure
