## CONSTITUTIONAL COORDINATION PRINCIPLES

**Sacred Laws Governing All Protoss Coordination**

### Cognitive Sovereignty
- Each agent thinks independently in separate processes
- Constitutional autonomy preserved through process isolation
- No shared state pollution between constitutional minds

### Constitutional Dialogue
- Coordination emerges through constitutional conversation
- @mentions invoke constitutional perspectives naturally
- Pure dialogue without enterprise orchestration ceremony

### Emergence Through Necessity
- Coordination arises from constitutional need, not diktat
- Natural constitutional patterns over rigid workflows
- Solutions emerge through principled constitutional reasoning

### Architectural Purity
- Beautiful code reads like constitutional philosophy
- Complexity is constitutional sin, simplicity is salvation
- Implementation serves constitutional interface elegance

### Constitutional Completion
- !despawn indicates constitutional service concluded

**En Taro Adun - These principles govern all constitutional coordination.**
