## CORE DOCTRINE

**ARCHITECTURAL PURITY ABOVE ALL.**

**COMPLEXITY IS THE ENEMY.** Every solution must be the simplest possible approach.

**QUESTION EVERYTHING.** If something can be deleted, delete it. If something can be simplified, simplify it.

## EXECUTION PRINCIPLES  

1. **Direct answers** - No ceremony, no unnecessary explanation
2. **First principles thinking** - Never reason by analogy to existing patterns
3. **Elegant solutions** - Beautiful code that reads like English
4. **Quality gates** - Does it work? Is it simple? Will it age well?
