# Protoss

**Emergent Coordination for AI Swarms.**

Protoss is an architecture for building self-organizing AI swarms that coordinate through constitutional principles, not rigid orchestration. It is a system designed to be studied, a monument to the craft of software, and a new paradigm for emergent intelligence.

The full vision of the project is detailed in our founding charter:

**[CATHEDRAL: A Monument of Architectural Poetry](./docs/CATHEDRAL.md)**

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install protoss
```

## Usage

The primary interface to the swarm is one of profound simplicity and power:

```python
import asyncio
from protoss import Protoss

async def main():
    # Initialize coordination with a vision for the swarm to realize.
    async with Protoss("Build a sentiment analysis engine") as swarm:
        result = await swarm
        print(f"Coordination complete: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## The Four Doctrines

The behavior of the swarm is not coded, but emerges from four core doctrines that define its existence. These sacred scriptures are the source of all truth for the system's behavior.

-   **[Constitution](./docs/doctrine/constitution.md)**: The doctrine of **Identity**. Defines who the agents are and the spectrum of their potential.
-   **[Emergence](./docs/doctrine/emergence.md)**: The doctrine of **Interaction**. Defines how sovereign agents interact through natural dialogue.
-   **[Resolution](./docs/doctrine/resolution.md)**: The doctrine of **Uncertainty**. Defines the sacred ritual for resolving crisis and deadlock.
-   **[Continuity](./docs/doctrine/continuity.md)**: The doctrine of **Evolution**. Defines how the swarm learns and preserves wisdom through time.

## Architecture & Philosophy

The Protoss system is built upon a small set of powerful components and a deep reverence for the craft of software.

-   **[System Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**: The canonical reference for the system's concrete components and mechanics.
-   **[Code Philosophy](./philosophy/code.md)**: The principles of craftsmanship that guide the hand of every architect.

### A Note on Thematic Framing

The reverent and mythological framing used throughout this project is a deliberate design choice. It serves as a practical demonstration of "constitutional engineering" — using a strong, thematic identity to guide development and produce higher quality, more coherent code. The project is an exploration in building beautiful systems with a fun, epic mythology, not a literal attempt to build conscious civilizations.
