# Protoss

**An architecture for emergent AI coordination through pure conversation.**

Protoss is not a multi-agent framework. It is a minimalist container built on a single, powerful discovery: **coordination logic can live in an agent's reasoning, not in the framework's code.**

The system rejects all forms of rigid orchestration in favor of a swarm of sovereign agents that coordinate their actions by reading and contributing to a shared, human-readable transcript.

## The Scriptures

The project's philosophy, principles, and architecture are codified in a set of core documents:

1.  **[cathedral.md](./docs/cathedral.md)**: The **Vision**. The "Why."
2.  **[doctrine.md](./docs/doctrine.md)**: The **Principles**. The "What."
3.  **[ascension.md](./docs/ascension.md)**: The **Path**. The "How."

For strategic context, see the [architecture](./docs/architecture.md), [roadmap.md](./docs/roadmap.md) and [safety.md](./docs/safety.md).

*This project is an exploration in radical simplicity and a monument to the craft of software. The reverent language is a deliberate design choice to instill a strong constitutional identity, guiding development toward a coherent and singular vision.*
