# Protoss

**Emergent Coordination for AI Swarms.**

Protoss is an architecture for building self-organizing AI swarms that coordinate through constitutional principles, not rigid orchestration. Currently in **Phase 0 — human orchestration with constitutional guidance** while building toward bounded sovereignty. A monument to the craft of software and a testbed for emergent intelligence within explicit safety layers.

**Sacred Texts:**
- **[CATHEDRAL](./docs/CATHEDRAL.md)** — The founding charter
- **[ROADMAP](./docs/ROADMAP.md)** — Evolution toward bounded sovereignty
- **[SAFETY](./docs/SAFETY.md)** — Layered constitutional safeguards

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install protoss
```

## Usage

The primary interface to the swarm is one of profound simplicity and power:

```python
import asyncio
from protoss import Protoss

async def main():
    async with Protoss("Build a sentiment analysis engine") as swarm:
        result = await swarm
        print(f"Coordination complete: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## The Four Doctrines

The behavior of the swarm emerges from four core doctrines. These sacred scriptures are the source of all truth for the system's behavior:

- **[Constitution](./docs/doctrine/constitution.md)** — The doctrine of **Identity**. Who the agents are and the spectrum of their potential.
- **[Emergence](./docs/doctrine/emergence.md)** — The doctrine of **Interaction**. How sovereign agents coordinate through natural dialogue.
- **[Resolution](./docs/doctrine/resolution.md)** — The doctrine of **Uncertainty**. The sacred ritual for resolving crisis and deadlock.
- **[Continuity](./docs/doctrine/continuity.md)** — The doctrine of **Evolution**. How the swarm learns and preserves wisdom through time.

## Architecture & Philosophy

The system is built upon powerful components and deep reverence for the craft of software:

- **[System Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** — Canonical reference for concrete components and mechanics
- **[Code Philosophy](./philosophy/code.md)** — Principles of craftsmanship that guide every architect

### A Note on Thematic Framing

The reverent and mythological framing is a deliberate design choice. It serves as practical demonstration of "constitutional engineering" — using strong thematic identity to guide development and produce higher quality, more coherent code. An exploration in building beautiful systems with epic mythology, not a literal attempt to build conscious civilizations.
