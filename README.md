**Constitutional governance for AI swarms. Multi-agent coordination without collapse.**

Distributed AI coordination through constitutional frameworks, democratic deliberation, and systematic escalation protocols.

## Core Insight

Constitutional identity frameworks enable persistent multi-agent coordination by routing the same model through different governance contexts. Individual agent intelligence remains constant - coordination governance provides the scaling advantage.

## Architecture

**Infrastructure (Buildings):**
- **NEXUS** - CLI command center, auto-spawn Carrier, human interface
- **PYLON** - WebSocket grid, powers Khala network
- **GATEWAY** - Agent spawning facility, lifecycle management

**Mobile Units (Agents):**
- **ZEALOT** - Task execution, natural coordination, emergent specialization
- **ARCHON** - Knowledge synthesis, institutional memory via @mention
- **SACRED FOUR** - Constitutional deliberation and governance

**SACRED FOUR** - Constitutional leadership through context asymmetry:
- **Tassadar** - Pragmatic vision, shipping constraints
- **Zeratul** - Shadow investigation, hidden risks  
- **Artanis** - Collaborative synthesis, unity building
- **Fenix** - Direct execution, complexity cutting

**KHALA** - Slack for agents, `§PSI|pathway|sender: content` protocol

**Command Flow:** `NEXUS → CARRIER → KHALA → MOBILE UNITS`  
**Escalation:** `ZEALOT uncertainty → SACRED FOUR → CARRIER → NEXUS`

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start coordination infrastructure
protoss start

# Spawn individual units
protoss spawn zealot "implement JWT authentication" 
protoss spawn archon "synthesize auth patterns" 

# Deploy natural coordination squads
protoss warp "build user management API"      # 3 agents (default)
protoss warp 5 "complex microservice design" # 5 agents for complex tasks

# Monitor coordination activity
protoss monitor
protoss status

# Sacred Four constitutional guidance
protoss conclave "should we refactor to microservices?"
```

## Research Question

Can Claude 5-level intelligence research Claude 6-level breakthroughs when properly coordinated through constitutional governance frameworks?

The system tests coordination scaling as a pathway to recursive self-improvement - building coordination substrate that could support autonomous AI research teams.

## Implementation Status

**Current (v0.1):**
- ✅ Core infrastructure (Gateway, Khala, Nexus)
- ✅ Natural coordination units (Zealot, Archon)  
- ✅ Sacred Four governance (Tassadar, Zeratul, Artanis, Fenix)
- ✅ PSI protocol + @mention reactive spawning
- ✅ CLI interface with monitoring

**Target capabilities:**
- Hour-level autonomy (current research target)
- Day-level autonomy (production threshold)
- Month-level autonomy (recursive improvement threshold)
