# Protoss

**Constitutional governance for AI swarms. StarCraft-inspired coordination architecture.**

Same model, different context asymmetry. Democratic deliberation, escalation safety, month-level autonomy.

## Core Insight

**Individual LLM reasoning isn't the secret sauce - governance for reasoning is.**

Context asymmetry + coordination + escalation = emergent error correction.

## Architecture

**Infrastructure (Buildings):**
- **NEXUS** - CLI command center, auto-spawn Carrier, human interface
- **PYLON** - WebSocket grid, powers Khala network
- **GATEWAY** - Agent spawning facility, lifecycle management

**Mobile Units (Agents):**
- **ZEALOT** - Task execution, uncertainty escalation
- **STALKER** - Quality enforcement via Guardian Protocol
- **CARRIER** - Human-swarm bridge, launches Interceptors
- **ARCHON** - Knowledge synthesis, institutional memory

**SACRED FOUR** - Constitutional leadership through context asymmetry:
- **Tassadar** - Pragmatic vision, shipping constraints
- **Zeratul** - Shadow investigation, hidden risks  
- **Artanis** - Collaborative synthesis, unity building
- **Fenix** - Direct execution, complexity cutting

**KHALA** - Slack for agents, `¬ßPSI|pathway|sender: content` protocol

**Command Flow:** `NEXUS ‚Üí CARRIER ‚Üí KHALA ‚Üí MOBILE UNITS`  
**Escalation:** `ZEALOT uncertainty ‚Üí SACRED FOUR ‚Üí CARRIER ‚Üí NEXUS`

## Quick Start

```bash
protoss start                    # Infrastructure online
protoss "build tokenizer"        # üõ∏ Auto-spawn Carrier, natural coordination
protoss "should we use React?"   # ‚Üí Carrier routes to Sacred Four internally
protoss "coordinate 5 agents"    # ‚Üí Carrier deploys squad internally
```

## The Test

**Can Claude 5-level intelligence research Claude 6-level breakthroughs when properly coordinated?**

Not building AGI - building coordination substrate for recursive improvement.

That's an empirical question only answered by building it.

## Status

**v0.1** - Core architecture, speculative features documented  
**Implementation:** Gateway/Khala/basic Zealots operational  
**Vision:** Month-level AI autonomy through constitutional coordination
