# Protoss: Coordination Architecture for Recursive AI Improvement

**Minimal self-correcting substrate for AI coordination. Knobs, not flaws.**

## Core Insight

**The secret sauce isn't individual LLM reasoning - it's governance for reasoning.**

**Context asymmetry + coordination + escalation = emergent error correction**

Same computational substrate, different information lenses, democratic coordination.

## Constitutional AI Swarm

**Not just multi-agent coordination - constitutional governance for AI swarms.**

**Traditional:** Smart agents + coordination protocols  
**Protoss:** Same agents + constitutional governance + escalation safety

**Result:** Self-correcting distributed intelligence that gets stronger under uncertainty.

## Design Philosophy: Knobs Not Flaws

**Every "problem" is a tuning parameter:**
- **Scalability friction** â†’ Message routing optimization via Probes
- **Metacognitive calibration** â†’ Constitutional oversight via Sacred Four
- **Recursive safety** â†’ Escalation protocol with human checkpoints
- **Operational complexity** â†’ Observability tooling and monitoring

## Architectural Advantage

**System blindspots addressed by design:**
- Individual agent uncertainty â†’ Democratic deliberation (Sacred Four)
- Coordination failures â†’ Explicit escalation protocol
- Knowledge fragmentation â†’ Archon synthesis and institutional memory
- Quality degradation â†’ Stalker enforcement of architectural purity
- Resource waste â†’ Probe allocation and priority management

**System self-corrects through coordination, not just individual intelligence.**

## Three-Layer Error Correction

1. **Individual metacognition** - Zealots assess own uncertainty
2. **Constitutional deliberation** - Sacred Four resolve conflicts  
3. **Human escalation** - Final safety override for deadlocks

**Binary escalation: "We got this" OR "Summon human"**

## The Recursive Improvement Test

**Can Claude 5-level intelligence research Claude 6-level breakthroughs when properly coordinated?**

**Test case:** Month-level AI autonomy through coordination infrastructure.

**Not building AGI - building coordination substrate that could support recursive improvement.**

**That's an empirical question only answered by building it.**

## Bottom Line

**Governance system for AI reasoning. Turns volatility into coordination strength through democratic constitutional oversight.**

**Frightening, plausible, architecturally beautiful.**
