# Protoss Roadmap

## Vision
**Can constitutional frameworks enable AI swarm coordination that transcends individual agent capabilities?**

Ultimate test: **Recursive Self-Improvement** - swarm improves its own constitutional framework while maintaining alignment and working on external projects.

## Constitutional Evolution Phases

### Phase 0: Human Orchestration (Current)
**Reality**: Human control with constitutional themes

**Foundational Infrastructure** (Complete):
- Bus & Gateway: Core messaging and agent-spawning mechanics
- Data-Driven Agents: Generic Agent class configured by AGENT_REGISTRY
- Core Doctrines: Constitution, emergence, resolution, continuity

**Monitoring & Observability**:
- `protoss monitor`: Real-time swarm view (active agents, channels, activity)
- `protoss status`: Current swarm state snapshot
- Khala Visualization: Real-time coordination flow analysis

**Conversational Interface & Resource Management**:
- `protoss ask`: Strategic questions to @arbiter
- Escalation Protocol: Agent-to-human summoning process
- Resource Tracking: Token usage, cost tracking, rate limiting

**Advanced Coordination Patterns**:
- Git Coordination: Multi-agent work on single codebase (branch-per-task, bus-coordinated merges, conflict resolution via @conclave)
- Multi-Channel Coordination: Cross-channel agent protocols
- Constitutional Testing: Framework validation under human control

### Phase 1: Bounded Constitutional Evolution
**Architecture**: Constitutional changes at checkpoints with human oversight

- Constitutional kernel design (immutable invariants + enforcement)
- Drift detection system (behavioral monitoring against constitutional expectations)
- Checkpoint ritual implementation (human review pipeline for constitutional amendments)
- Constitutional DNA embedding (framework integration in agent spawning process)
- Version control integration (protected branches + cryptographic signatures)
- Constitutional Evolution: AI systems authoring amendments based on coordination experience

### Phase 2: Autonomous Constitutional Governance
**Architecture**: Self-governed emergence under constitutional invariants

- Meta-coordination agents (analyze swarm coordination patterns)
- Safe experimentation environments (isolated constitutional modification testing)
- Constitutional approval flow (swarm proposes changes for human review per SAFETY.md)
- Autonomous governance protocols (self-modification within invariant constraints)
- Multi-swarm federation (coordination between sovereign cathedral instances with different constitutional identities)

## Success Metrics
- **Phase 0**: Effective orchestration with constitutional guidance, complete human oversight
- **Phase 1**: Constitutional evolution maintains alignment with human review, drift detection works
- **Phase 2**: Emergent coordination capabilities, recursive self-improvement within bounds

**No phase proceeds without demonstrated safety at the previous level.**

**Bounded sovereignty through constitutional evolution, not absolute autonomy.**
