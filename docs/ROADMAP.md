# Protoss Roadmap

## The Vision

**Can constitutional frameworks enable AI swarm coordination that transcends individual agent capabilities?**

The ultimate test remains unchanged: **Recursive Self-Improvement**. A swarm that can reason about, and safely improve, its own constitutional framework while executing complex tasks.

Our path to this vision is now clarified, proceeding in three phases built upon the validated foundation of conversational emergence.

### Phase 0: The Foundational Core (Complete)

This phase culminated in the "radical simplification" and the validation of the core hypothesis.

-   **Architectural Reality:** A minimalist framework consisting of a dumb `Bus` (transcript) and a smart `Agent` (reasoning engine).
-   **Core Breakthrough:** Proved that multiple agents can coordinate to build functional, multi-file software through pure conversation, without any orchestration layer.
-   **Key Principle Validated:** Coordination logic can live in the agent's constitutional reasoning, not in the framework's code.

*We have established a sound foundation. The next phase is about making it robust.*

### Phase 1: Stabilization & Specialization

The goal of this phase is to move from a working prototype to a reliable and efficient system, and to cultivate more sophisticated emergent behaviors.

1.  **Stabilize the Execution Layer:** The conversational swarm demonstrated resilience by talking its way through tool-use errors. The immediate priority is to improve the reliability of the underlying `Cogency` tool execution, making conversational recovery an exception, not the rule.

2.  **Sharpen Constitutional Identity:** The agents currently default to a collaborative consensus. We must refine their `IDENTITY` and `GUIDELINES` to elicit more diverse and specialized roles (e.g., the skepticism of the Zealot, the analytical rigor of the Sentinel). This is the primary lever for increasing the swarm's cognitive power.

3.  **Cultivate Emergent Protocols:** We will begin re-introducing the concepts from the old `resolution` and `continuity` doctrines not as framework features, but as conversational patterns taught to the agents via their constitutional `GUIDELINES`. The goal is to have the swarm *develop* deadlock resolution and memory management strategies on its own.

4.  **Develop Observability:** Create tooling to monitor the conversational transcript in real-time. Since the conversation *is* the coordination, observing it is the key to understanding the swarm's behavior.

### Phase 2: Autonomous Governance

With a stable and specialized swarm, we can once again approach the ultimate goal.

-   **Meta-Coordination:** Introduce agents whose primary function is to observe, analyze, and comment on the coordination patterns of other agents.
-   **Constitutional Evolution:** Task the swarm with proposing modifications to its own constitutional `GUIDELINES` to improve its efficiency and safety.
-   **Recursive Self-Improvement:** The ultimate test, where the swarm can safely and successfully apply this entire process to its own foundational code.

*The path is no longer about building a complex machine, but about cultivating an intelligent organism.*
