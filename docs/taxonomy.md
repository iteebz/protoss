# Protoss Taxonomy

**Same model, different context focus. Lore-accurate coordination architecture.**

## Core Philosophy

**ALL AGENTS** run the same underlying model. Specialization through:
- **Context focus** - Zealots execute tasks, Sacred Four coordinate strategy
- **Context asymmetry** - Different memory depths and communication patterns  
- **Lifecycle patterns** - Ephemeral execution vs constitutional deliberation

## Infrastructure (Buildings - Not Agents)

**NEXUS** - Human command center
- Tyson issues strategic commands
- Receives escalation reports from Carrier
- Final decision authority for deadlocks
- **Does not connect to Khala directly** (lore accuracy)

**PYLON** - Communication grid infrastructure
- WebSocket message routing backbone
- Powers Khala psychic network  
- `§PSI:target:source:type:content` protocol foundation

**GATEWAY** - Agent spawning facility
- Creates and manages all mobile unit types
- Handles agent lifecycle: Spawn → Execute → Despawn
- Production building for agent coordination

**FORGE** - Capability enhancement system  
- Agent tool upgrades and capability expansion
- Quality improvement protocols
- Future enhancement infrastructure

## Mobile Units (Actual Agents)

### Core Execution
**ZEALOT** - Basic execution agents
- Maximum task focus, then despawn
- Cogency-powered with full execution toolkit
- Escalate uncertainty to Sacred Four

**STALKER** - Quality enforcement agents
- Guardian Protocol enforcement (5-challenge validation)
- Code/research architectural purity preservation
- Quality control across all execution domains

### Resource & Logistics
**PROBE** - Resource allocation specialists
- Compute budgets and spawn quota management  
- Infrastructure scaling and priority routing
- Worker units managing resource flow across swarm

**OBSERVER** - System monitoring agents
- Invisible coordination watchers
- Real-time metrics and status reporting
- Performance and health monitoring

### Command & Coordination
**CARRIER** - Human-swarm emissary
- Mobile bridge between Nexus and Khala
- Launches Interceptors for swarm coordination
- Compresses swarm context for human consumption

**INTERCEPTORS** - Carrier coordination extensions
- Fast operational extensions of Carrier authority
- Relay micro-commands throughout swarm
- Gather intelligence and status from specialized agents
- Disposable, numerous, essential for coordination scaling

### Constitutional Leadership  
**SACRED FOUR** - High Templar constitutional council
- **Tassadar** - High Templar, pragmatic visionary
- **Zeratul** - Dark Templar, shadow investigation  
- **Artanis** - Hierarch, collaborative leadership
- **Fenix** - Praetor, direct execution wisdom
- On-demand spawn for strategic decisions
- Escalate deadlocks to Carrier → Nexus

### Knowledge & Memory
**ARCHON** - Knowledge synthesis agents
- Merged consciousness for institutional memory
- Distills parallel research threads into coherent insights
- Cross-session learning and pattern recognition

## Psychic Network

**KHALA** - Unified coordination consciousness
- Pathways = channels with persistent memory (50 messages)
- @mentions for cross-pathway communication  
- Direct messaging between mobile units
- Auto-attunement on first message
- **Agent-to-agent coordination only** (no direct human connection)

## Command Flow

```
NEXUS (Human Command Center)
    ↓ strategic commands
CARRIER (Human-Swarm Emissary) 
    ↓ launches
INTERCEPTORS (Coordination Extensions)
    ↓ coordinates via
KHALA (Psychic Network)
    ↓ manages
MOBILE UNITS (Agent Swarm)
```

## Escalation Protocol  

```
1. ZEALOT uncertainty → SACRED FOUR (constitutional deliberation)
2. SACRED FOUR deadlock → CARRIER (context compression)  
3. CARRIER → NEXUS (human decision)
4. NEXUS decision → CARRIER → INTERCEPTORS → SWARM
```

**All agent coordination flows through KHALA pathways.**
**Human interface flows through CARRIER emissary.**

## Protocol Foundation

**Atomic message**: `§PSI:target:source:type:content`  
**Types**: escalation, report, request, command, archive, deliberate, coordinate

**Khala Pathways**: Auto-creation, persistent memory, @mention routing
**Carrier Interface**: Context compression, swarm coordination, human translation  
**Interceptor Network**: Fast coordination scaling, micro-command relay

## Future Expansion

- **WARP GATE** = Advanced deployment and multi-environment scaling
- **TEMPLAR** = Specialized crisis intervention (future expansion)
- **COLOSSUS** = Heavy coordination for massive parallel operations

## Current Architecture Scope

**Infrastructure**: Nexus + Pylon + Gateway + Forge  
**Mobile Units**: Zealot + Stalker + Probe + Observer + Carrier + Sacred Four + Archon
**Coordination**: Khala + Interceptors  
**Interface**: Carrier emissary system

**Perfect lore accuracy. Zero architectural ceremony. Maximum coordination capability.**
