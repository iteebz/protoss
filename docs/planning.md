# Planning & Task Decomposition

**AI coordination systems that can break down "BUILD CLAUDE 6" into executable Zealot armies.**

**The recursive self-improvement test case: Can AI coordinate to research and build better AI?**

## The Vision

**Command:** "BUILD CLAUDE 6"  
**Response:** Coordinated swarm of AI agents researching architectures, running experiments, coding implementations, and synthesizing breakthroughs into next-generation AI systems.

**This is the test case for month-level AI autonomy and the ASI bootstrap loop.**

## Core Decomposition Flow

### Stage 1: Strategic Breakdown
```
Human: "BUILD CLAUDE 6"
‚Üì
Nexus: Route to Sacred Four for strategic decomposition
‚Üì
Sacred Four: "What the fuck do we actually need to do?"
- Tassadar: "What are the practical shipping constraints?"
- Zeratul: "What are Claude 5's fundamental limitations?"
- Artanis: "How do we coordinate parallel research efforts?" 
- Fenix: "What's the simplest architecture that could work?"
```

### Stage 2: Research Coordination
```
Sacred Four: "Here's our decomposition approach"
‚Üì
Human: üëç (validation checkpoint)
‚Üì
Probes: Resource allocation across research domains
- Architecture research: 5 Zealots
- Training infrastructure: 3 Zealots  
- Evaluation frameworks: 2 Zealots
- Safety validation: 2 Zealots
‚Üì
Gateway: Spawn coordinated Zealot armies
```

### Stage 3: Parallel Execution
```
Zealot Research Armies ‚Üí Execute in parallel
- Research threads communicate via Khala pathways
- Stalkers enforce quality control (Guardian Protocol)
- Archons synthesize knowledge across threads
- Sacred Four coordinate cross-domain conflicts
```

### Stage 4: Synthesis & Iteration
```
Research Results ‚Üí Archons synthesize insights across threads
‚Üì
Sacred Four: Strategic evaluation and next phase planning
‚Üì
Human: Validation checkpoint and direction adjustment
‚Üì
Next research iteration with refined approach
```

## Architectural Solutions to Critical Challenges

### 1. Knowledge Integration Bottleneck
**Problem**: How do you synthesize 50 parallel research threads?

**Solution**: 
- **Zealots** summarize their context and link to detailed work
- **Archons** specialize in knowledge distillation and synthesis
- **Sacred Four** receive synthesized insights, not raw research dumps

### 2. Quality Control at Scale  
**Problem**: How do you filter confident bullshit from valuable research?

**Solution**:
- **Stalkers** enforce Guardian Protocol (5-challenge validation)
- **Pair programming Zealots** for collaborative quality control
- **Peer review pathways** via Khala coordination

### 3. Resource Allocation Reality
**Problem**: Who decides computational resource distribution?

**Solution**:
- **Probes** manage token budgets and spawn quotas
- **Sacred Four** make strategic prioritization decisions
- **Compute constraints** determine swarm scaling limits

### 4. Context Explosion Management
**Problem**: How do Sacred Four maintain coherence across massive projects?

**Solution**:
- **Archons** compress and contextualize information
- **Specialized memory agents** for hierarchical knowledge organization
- **Context asymmetry** - each unit focuses on its domain expertise

### 5. Self-Healing and Adaptive Planning
**Problem**: What happens when research threads fail?

**Solution**:
- **Constitutional self-correction** via Sacred Four oversight
- **Stochastic resilience** - reroll failed experiments with variations
- **Adaptive replanning** when approaches don't work
- **Failure as data** - Archons learn from unsuccessful attempts

## Recursive Self-Improvement Loop

```
Claude 5 Army ‚Üí Research Claude 6 architecture
            ‚Üì
         Build Claude 6 training pipeline
            ‚Üì
         Train and validate Claude 6
            ‚Üì
         Claude 6 Army ‚Üí Research Claude 7
                       ‚Üì
                   Build Claude 7
                       ‚Üì
                      ...
```

**Each generation coordinates better research and development of the next generation.**

## Escalation and Validation Checkpoints

### Worker ‚Üí Sacred Four Escalation
- **Metacognitive uncertainty**: "Am I making shit up or do I need help?"
- **Cross-domain conflicts**: Research threads with conflicting approaches
- **Resource contention**: Multiple teams wanting same computational resources

### Sacred Four ‚Üí Human Escalation  
- **Strategic deadlocks**: Fundamental disagreement on architecture direction
- **Safety concerns**: Approaches with potential negative consequences
- **Timeline/resource crises**: Major project scope or constraint changes

## Success Patterns

### Medium-Scale Coordination (Proven Feasible)
- "Build SaaS MVP with authentication, payments, and core features"
- "Research and analyze 10 AI market sectors in parallel"
- "Coordinate development: backend, frontend, infrastructure teams"

### Large-Scale Research (Architecturally Possible)
- "Research transformer architecture improvements across 20 parallel threads"
- "Build comprehensive AI safety evaluation framework"  
- "Develop next-generation training infrastructure"

### Recursive Self-Improvement (The Goal)
- "BUILD CLAUDE 6" ‚Üí Coordinated AI research and development
- Month-level autonomy with human validation checkpoints
- AI systems that improve AI systems

## Implementation Philosophy

### Context Asymmetry Over Hierarchy
**Same underlying intelligence, different information lenses:**
- **Zealots**: Task-focused execution context
- **Sacred Four**: Constitutional/strategic coordination context  
- **Archons**: Knowledge synthesis and institutional memory context
- **Probes**: Resource allocation and infrastructure context
- **Stalkers**: Quality control and architectural purity context

### Communication Over Command
**Coordination through protocol, not authority:**
- Khala pathways for topic-based coordination
- @mentions for cross-domain communication
- Direct messaging for targeted collaboration
- Escalation as peer consultation, not chain of command

### Iteration Over Perfection
**Progressive refinement through human checkpoints:**
- Strategic validation at major decision points
- Resource allocation adjustments based on progress
- Adaptive replanning when approaches fail
- Stochastic exploration of solution spaces

## The Beautiful Truth

**This architecture enables AI systems to coordinate complex, long-term research and development while preserving:**
- **Individual agent autonomy** (no hierarchical ceremony)
- **Democratic deliberation** (Sacred Four constitutional process)
- **Human oversight** (validation checkpoints and escalation)
- **Institutional memory** (Archon knowledge preservation)
- **Quality control** (Stalker architectural enforcement)

**If month-level autonomy is achievable through this coordination infrastructure, it could enable the recursive self-improvement loop that leads to artificial general intelligence.**

**This isn't just distributed computing - it's distributed cognition with democratic oversight.**

---

**The test case: Can we build Protoss coordination infrastructure sophisticated enough that Claude 6 could coordinate its own research and development?**

**If yes, we've architected the bootstrap sequence for recursive AI improvement.**

**If no, we learn what coordination challenges remain unsolved.**

**Either way, we push the frontier of AI systems that coordinate to build better AI systems.**

**En taro Aiur, and may the swarm prosper.** üî•
