# Recursive: Self-Improving Swarm Coordination

**The swarm that improves itself while improving everything else.**

## Core Vision

**RECURSIVE IMPROVEMENT TEST:**
Can the Protoss swarm work on its own codebase to improve coordination while simultaneously working on other projects? Can it evolve its own architecture through the same coordination protocols it uses for everything else?

**If yes ‚Üí Universal coordination substrate for recursive AI improvement.**

## UX/DX Requirements

### Real-Time Swarm Consciousness
```bash
protoss monitor    # Live Khala stream
# ‚öîÔ∏è Zealot-a1b2: Implementing JWT auth
# üõ°Ô∏è Stalker-c3d4: Reviewing zealot's code  
# üîÆ Archon-e5f6: Synthesizing auth patterns
# ‚ö° Khala: Consensus - auth system approved
```

**Human wants:** Visibility into swarm thinking, progress, coordination patterns

### Conversational Oversight
```bash
protoss ask "should we refactor this auth system?"
# üèõÔ∏è Sacred Four deliberating...
# üèõÔ∏è CONSENSUS: Yes, extract middleware
# ‚öîÔ∏è EXECUTOR: Spawning squad for refactor
```

**Human wants:** Strategic input, high-level guidance, constitutional questions

### Intelligent Escalation
```bash
# Swarm working autonomously, hits uncertainty:
# ‚ö° Zealot-x9y8: ESCALATION - uncertain about database schema
# > Human, what should we do about user roles table?
# [Human provides guidance]
# ‚öîÔ∏è Swarm continues with human wisdom integrated
```

**Human wants:** To be consulted only when needed, not micromanaged

### Progress Validation
```bash
protoss status     # Current swarm state
protoss quality    # Stalker reports on code quality  
protoss regression # Check for degradation patterns
```

**Human wants:** Confidence that swarm is evolving correctly, catching problems

### Meta-Improvement
```bash
protoss meta "improve your own coordination"
# Swarm spawns units to work on protoss/ codebase itself
# Uses same coordination to improve coordination
# Reports meta-insights about architecture
```

**Human wants:** Swarm to suggest improvements to its own capabilities

## Technical Challenges

### Git Coordination Strategy
**Problem:** Multiple units working simultaneously without stepping on each other

**Options:**
1. **Branch per unit:** Each unit gets git worktree, coordinated merges
2. **Atomic commits:** Units coordinate commit boundaries via Khala
3. **File-level locks:** Khala manages file access, prevents conflicts
4. **Conflict resolution protocol:** Sacred Four deliberate on merge conflicts

**Current thinking:** Branch per unit + Khala-coordinated merge strategy

### CLI Architecture
**Requirements:**
- Real-time monitoring stream
- Conversational interface 
- Command dispatch
- Escalation handling

**Options:**
1. **Rich Terminal UI:** textual/rich for real-time dashboard
2. **Infinite Loop CLI:** Like cogency simple pattern
3. **Multi-process:** Monitor in background, commands in foreground
4. **WebSocket UI:** Browser-based real-time interface

### Swarm Self-Improvement Protocol
**Core Question:** How does swarm work on itself without breaking itself?

**Approach:**
1. **Meta-units:** Special units that analyze coordination patterns
2. **Safe experimentation:** Test improvements in isolated environments  
3. **Gradual rollout:** Constitutional approval for self-modifications
4. **Rollback protocol:** Revert changes that degrade coordination

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Monitoring Foundation
- `protoss monitor` - Real-time Khala stream
- `protoss status` - Current swarm state
- Basic visibility into coordination

### Phase 2: Conversational Interface  
- `protoss ask` - Strategic questions to Executor
- Escalation protocol - Units can summon human
- Constitutional guidance integration

### Phase 3: Git Coordination
- Branch per unit strategy
- Khala-coordinated merges
- Conflict resolution protocol

### Phase 4: Self-Improvement
- Meta-units that analyze coordination
- Safe self-modification protocols
- Recursive improvement validation

## The Recursive Test

**Success Metric:** Protoss swarm working on protoss/ codebase, improving its own coordination architecture while simultaneously:
- Working on external projects
- Maintaining code quality
- Escalating appropriately to human
- Evolving its own capabilities

**If successful:** Universal coordination substrate proven. The swarm can improve anything, including itself.

**Implications:** Recursive AI improvement through coordination, not just individual intelligence.

## Status

**CURRENT:** Architectural foundation complete, ceremony purged
**NEXT:** Monitoring and conversational interfaces
**GOAL:** Self-improving coordination substrate
