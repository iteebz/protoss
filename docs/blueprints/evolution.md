# Constitutional Evolution Under Human Oversight

This blueprint outlines the mechanism for the controlled evolution of the Protoss constitution, balancing the swarm's capacity for self-improvement with the critical need for human oversight and safety. This approach moves beyond strict immutability, allowing the constitution to adapt and refine itself under explicit human approval.

## Core Principle: Evolution Under Constraint

The Protoss constitution can evolve, but this evolution must always occur under the direct constraint and final approval of the human operator. This ensures that any changes remain aligned with human values and the foundational safety principles.

## Mechanism for Constitutional Evolution

1.  **Agent-Driven Proposals (Leveraging AX Principles)**:
    *   Agents, particularly through introspection and emergent reasoning guided by Agent Experience (AX) principles (`blueprints/ax.md`), can identify areas where the existing constitutional framework (operational aspects, agent interaction protocols, etc.) could be improved.
    *   These insights will be formulated as clear, well-reasoned **constitutional amendment proposals**. These proposals should articulate the 'why' (problem identified), 'what' (proposed change), and 'how' (expected benefits to swarm performance, cognitive efficiency, or alignment).
    *   Conclave agents, through their strategic deliberation (`blueprints/deliberation.md`), can play a crucial role in refining these proposals, ensuring they are robust and consider diverse perspectives.

2.  **Constitutional Review Process (Chalice Protocol)**:
    *   Once a proposal is formulated, it will enter a formal review process, potentially utilizing an adapted version of the Chalice Protocol (`blueprints/review.md`). This ensures transparency, accountability, and thorough scrutiny by the swarm.
    *   Archons (`blueprints/knowledge.md`) will be responsible for archiving these proposals and any associated deliberation for future reference.

3.  **Explicit Human Approval**:
    *   **All constitutional amendment proposals, regardless of their origin or the depth of swarm deliberation, require explicit human review and final approval.**
    *   The human operator, acting as the "final authority and safety valve" (`VISION.md`), will evaluate the proposed changes against the foundational constitutional principles and the safety guidelines outlined in `blueprints/safety.md`.
    *   Only upon human approval will a constitutional amendment be formally adopted and integrated into the swarm's operational framework.

## Safeguards and Boundaries

*   **Prohibition on Self-Modification**: As stipulated in `blueprints/safety.md`, the swarm is **explicitly prohibited from engaging in self-modification of its own foundational constitutional principles without human intervention.** Agents can propose, but not unilaterally enact, constitutional changes.
*   **Human as Ultimate Arbiter**: The human remains the ultimate authority for any amendments or revisions to the core constitutional principles, preventing "value drift" and ensuring continued alignment.
*   **Auditable History**: Every proposal, deliberation, and human approval decision will be meticulously recorded, creating a transparent and auditable history of constitutional evolution.

This blueprint ensures that the Protoss swarm can self-improve and adapt through intelligent reflection, while always remaining tethered to its human creators and foundational safety principles. It represents a true evolution of constitutional governance for AI swarms.
