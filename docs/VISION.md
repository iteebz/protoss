# PROTOSS - Constitutional AI Coordination Architecture

**Vision**: Month-level AI autonomy through constitutional governance  
**Core insight**: Constitutional limitations enhance rather than restrict intelligence - like sonnets create better poetry through formal constraints

## Research Question

**Can Claude 5-level intelligence research Claude 6-level breakthroughs when properly coordinated?**

Multi-agent systems consistently collapse within ~10 minutes without human intervention. Individual AI intelligence scaling plateaus, but coordination scaling could enable organizational intelligence. PROTOSS tests whether constitutional governance frameworks can extend coordination from minutes to months.

## Constitutional Governance Architecture

**Core principle**: Same model, different constitutional context asymmetry. Democratic deliberation through information lenses, not authority hierarchy.

### Cognitive Diversity Architecture
Constitutional identity frameworks prevent sycophantic collapse in homogeneous model coordination. Same computational substrate, different reasoning lenses create genuine disagreement necessary for robust deliberation. Future: explicit multi-provider coordination when available.

**Execution pattern**: Ephemeral functional agents with persistent constitutional identity. Cogency conversation continuity enables on-demand context across channels without stateful subscription complexity.

### Infrastructure Components

**CLI** - Human command center, final authority and safety valve  
**Server** - WebSocket infrastructure powering Bus communication network  
**Gateway** - Agent spawning facility with constitutional identity injection  

**Bus** - Real-time coordination substrate using Message protocol: `Message(channel, sender, content)`

### Constitutional Units

**Zealot** - Task execution with uncertainty escalation (constitutional principles)  
**Archon** - Knowledge synthesis specialist, institutional memory curation  

**Conclave** - Constitutional leadership through perspective diversity:
- **Tassadar** - Pragmatic vision: "Can we ship a solution?"
- **Zeratul** - Critical analysis: "What are we missing?"  
- **Artanis** - Collaborative synthesis: "How do we unite perspectives?"
- **Fenix** - Direct execution: "What's the simplest path forward?"

Not hierarchy - distributed constitutional governance through conversation.

## Coordination Protocols

### Three-Layer Error Correction
1. **Individual metacognition** - Zealots assess own uncertainty
2. **Constitutional deliberation** - Conclave perspectives resolve conflicts  
3. **Human escalation** - Final safety override for deadlocks

**Binary escalation: "We got this" OR "Summon human"**

### Escalation Architecture
**Command Flow**: `CLI ‚Üí Bus ‚Üí Agents`  
**Escalation Flow**: `Zealot uncertainty ‚Üí Conclave consultation ‚Üí CLI`

Context asymmetry + coordination + escalation = emergent error correction. Same computational substrate, different information lenses, democratic coordination.

### Constitutional Deliberation Protocol

**Democratic Technical Decision-Making:**
1. **Independent Assessment**: Multiple agents provide genuine technical opinions without social pressure
2. **Open Disagreement**: Agents free to contradict user preferences and each other based on technical merit
3. **Synthesis Through Debate**: Better solutions emerge from honest technical argument, not compliance
4. **Consensus Implementation**: Single agent executes the collectively agreed solution
5. **Constitutional Review**: Other agents validate implementation against agreed standards

**No sycophantic collapse. No authoritarian override. Pure technical democracy.**

The pattern: User provides vision + constraints ‚Üí Agents provide independent technical assessments ‚Üí Democratic synthesis ‚Üí Implementation of consensus decision.

### Constitutional Code Review
Zealots enforce quality through constitutional identity:
- Beautiful code reads like English or it's bullshit
- Complexity is sin, simplicity is salvation
- Push back on bad ideas, especially each other's
- Code quality > consensus, always

### Memory Architecture
Archons provide cognitive curation, not mechanical similarity matching. Context over similarity, narrative thread preservation, emergent organization from usage patterns. The coherence substrate that makes coordination possible across time and agent lifecycles.

## Design Philosophy

**Constitutional constraints create excellence**: Like sonnets, formal constraints enhance rather than restrict intelligence. Democratic deliberation over authority hierarchy. Context asymmetry enables specialized intelligence. Emergent organization over imposed taxonomy.

**Knobs, not flaws**: Every coordination "problem" becomes a tuning parameter:
- Scalability friction ‚Üí Message routing optimization
- Metacognitive calibration ‚Üí Constitutional oversight via Sacred Four
- Recursive safety ‚Üí Escalation protocol with human checkpoints
- Operational complexity ‚Üí Observability tooling and monitoring

**System self-correction through coordination**: Individual agent uncertainty ‚Üí Democratic deliberation ‚Üí Explicit escalation protocol ‚Üí Human override. The system gets stronger under uncertainty through constitutional governance.

**Coordination substrate for recursive improvement**: Not building AGI - building infrastructure that could support autonomous AI research teams through proper governance frameworks.

## Target Capabilities

- **Hour-level autonomy** ‚Üí Current research target
- **Day-level autonomy** ‚Üí Production threshold  
- **Month-level autonomy** ‚Üí Recursive self-improvement threshold

Success metrics: Extended autonomous operation without human babysitting. Systems that remember decisions, learn from failures, coordinate without collapse.

## Target API

**Pure concurrency abstraction:**
```python
import protoss
protoss("research, experiment and build claude 6", agents=100, llm="claude-sonnet")
```

**Emergent coordination principles:**
- **Constitutional identities** as cognitive frameworks, not fixed roles
- **Ephemeral specialization** - agents adopt archon/zealot/sacred four perspectives as needed
- **Natural boundary enforcement** - whoever adopts archon identity gets archives/ access
- **Zero orchestration** - agents self-organize into coordination patterns
- **Human input**: Vision + resources. **Agent emergence**: Everything else.

## The Test

Building coordination substrate that scales from current 5-10 agent coordination to empirically validated limits through constitutional governance and institutional memory.

**Current target**: Prove month-level autonomy with realistic agent counts.
**Ultimate vision**: `protoss("task", agents=N)` where N is whatever actually works.

Empirical question only answered by building it.

## Recursive Self-Improvement Vision

**The Ultimate Test:** Can the Protoss coordination system work on its own codebase to improve coordination while simultaneously working on other projects? Can it evolve its own architecture through the same coordination protocols it uses for everything else?

**If yes ‚Üí Universal coordination substrate for recursive AI improvement.**

### Recursive Improvement Requirements

**Real-Time Coordination Consciousness:**
- Live Bus message streams showing agent coordination in real-time
- Visibility into swarm thinking, progress, and coordination patterns
- Constitutional deliberation transparency

**Conversational Strategic Oversight:**
- Strategic input and high-level guidance through Conclave consultation
- Human consulted only when needed, not micromanaged
- Constitutional questions and architectural guidance

**Intelligent Escalation Protocol:**
- Swarm working autonomously, escalates on uncertainty
- Human wisdom integrated when summoned
- Seamless coordination continuation post-guidance

**Meta-Improvement Capability:**
- Coordination system suggests improvements to its own capabilities
- Uses same coordination to improve coordination
- Reports meta-insights about architecture evolution

### The Recursive Test Success Metrics

**Success Metric:** Protoss coordination system working on protoss/ codebase, improving its own coordination architecture while simultaneously:
- Working on external projects
- Maintaining constitutional code quality
- Escalating appropriately to human oversight
- Evolving its own coordination capabilities

**If successful:** Universal coordination substrate proven. The system can improve anything, including itself.

**Implications:** Recursive AI improvement through coordination governance, not just individual intelligence scaling.

**Implementation Status:** Constitutional coordination foundation complete. Next: Monitoring and conversational interfaces for recursive improvement capability.

### Human-Swarm Coordination Patterns

**Real-Time Swarm Consciousness:**
```bash
protoss monitor    # Live Bus stream
# ‚öîÔ∏è Zealot-a1b2: Implementing JWT auth
# üõ°Ô∏è Stalker-c3d4: Reviewing zealot's code  
# üîÆ Archon-e5f6: Synthesizing auth patterns
# ‚ö° Bus: Consensus - auth system approved
```

**Conversational Oversight:**
```bash
protoss ask "should we refactor this auth system?"
# üèõÔ∏è Conclave deliberating...
# üèõÔ∏è CONSENSUS: Yes, extract middleware
# ‚öîÔ∏è EXECUTOR: Spawning squad for refactor
```

**Intelligent Escalation:**
```bash
# Swarm working autonomously, hits uncertainty:
# ‚ö° Zealot-x9y8: ESCALATION - uncertain about database schema
# > Human, what should we do about user roles table?
# [Human provides guidance]
# ‚öîÔ∏è Swarm continues with human wisdom integrated
```

**Meta-Improvement:**
```bash
protoss meta "improve your own coordination"
# Swarm spawns units to work on protoss/ codebase itself
# Uses same coordination to improve coordination
# Reports meta-insights about architecture
```

**Status:** CURRENT: Architectural foundation complete, ceremony purged. NEXT: Monitoring and conversational interfaces. GOAL: Self-improving coordination substrate.
