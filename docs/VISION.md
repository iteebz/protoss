# PROTOSS - Constitutional AI Coordination Architecture

**Vision**: Recursive self-improvement in autonomous AI swarms through constitutional governance  
**Core insight**: Constitutional limitations enhance rather than restrict intelligence - like sonnets create better poetry through formal constraints

## Research Question

**Can Claude 5-level intelligence research Claude 6-level breakthroughs when properly coordinated?**

Multi-agent systems consistently collapse within ~10 minutes without human intervention. Individual AI intelligence scaling plateaus, but coordination scaling could enable organizational intelligence. PROTOSS tests whether constitutional governance frameworks can create truly robust, long-term coordination.

## Constitutional Governance Architecture

**Core principle**: Same model, different constitutional context asymmetry. Democratic deliberation through information lenses, not authority hierarchy.

### Cognitive Diversity Architecture
Constitutional identity frameworks prevent sycophantic collapse in homogeneous model coordination. Same computational substrate, different reasoning lenses create genuine disagreement necessary for robust deliberation. Future: explicit multi-provider coordination when available.

**Execution pattern**: Ephemeral functional agents with persistent constitutional identity. Cogency conversation continuity enables on-demand context across channels without stateful subscription complexity.

### Infrastructure Components

**CLI** - Human command center, final authority and safety valve  
**Server** - WebSocket infrastructure powering Bus communication network  
**Gateway** - Pure spawning functions for agent processes, serving the Bus's spawning needs. (See [Emergence: The Constitutional Language of the Swarm](coordination.md) for more details on Gateway's role in emergent tasking).

**Bus** - Real-time coordination substrate using Message protocol: `Message(channel, sender, content)`. (Refer to [Emergence: The Constitutional Language of the Swarm](coordination.md) for the Bus's role in routing and spawning).

### Constitutional Units

Protoss operates with a set of constitutional agents, each embodying a distinct role in the coordination process. These agents are introduced in [Emergence: The Constitutional Language of the Swarm](coordination.md), and their detailed descriptions can be found in [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). The Conclave's strategic perspectives are elaborated in [deliberation.md](docs/deliberation.md).

Not hierarchy - distributed constitutional governance through conversation.

## Coordination Protocols

These protocols define the philosophical intent behind how agents coordinate and escalate. For technical implementation details, refer to [Coordination Patterns](coordination.md) and [Constitutional Deliberation](deliberation.md).

### Three-Layer Error Correction
1. **Individual metacognition** - Zealots assess own uncertainty
2. **Constitutional deliberation** - Conclave perspectives resolve conflicts  
3. **Human escalation** - Final safety override for deadlocks

**Binary escalation: "We got this" OR "Summon human"**

### Escalation Architecture
**Command Flow**: `CLI → Bus → Agents`  
**Escalation Flow**: `Zealot uncertainty → Conclave consultation → CLI`

Context asymmetry + coordination + escalation = emergent error correction. Same computational substrate, different information lenses, democratic coordination.

### Constitutional Deliberation Protocol

**Democratic Technical Decision-Making:**
1. **Independent Assessment**: Multiple agents provide genuine technical opinions without social pressure
2. **Open Disagreement**: Agents free to contradict user preferences and each other based on technical merit
3. **Synthesis Through Debate**: Better solutions emerge from honest technical argument, not compliance
4. **Consensus Implementation**: Single agent executes the collectively agreed solution
5. **Constitutional Review**: Other agents validate implementation against agreed standards

**No sycophantic collapse. No authoritarian override. Pure technical democracy.**

The pattern: User provides vision + constraints → Agents provide independent technical assessments → Democratic synthesis → Implementation of consensus decision.

### Constitutional Code Review
Zealots enforce quality through constitutional identity:
- Beautiful code reads like English or it's bullshit
- Complexity is sin, simplicity is salvation
- Push back on bad ideas, especially each other's
- Code quality > consensus, always

### Memory Architecture
Archons provide cognitive curation, not mechanical similarity matching. Context over similarity, narrative thread preservation, emergent organization from usage patterns. The coherence substrate that makes coordination possible across time and agent lifecycles.

## Design Philosophy

**Constitutional constraints create excellence**: Like sonnets, formal constraints enhance rather than restrict intelligence. Democratic deliberation over authority hierarchy. Context asymmetry enables specialized intelligence. Emergent organization over imposed taxonomy.

**Cognitive sovereignty over notification tyranny**: Agents choose when to synchronize with team updates rather than suffering constant interruptions. The `§end` delimiter signals readiness for fresh team context, protecting uninterrupted cognitive flow. Constitutional agents think like agents, not react like notification endpoints.

**Knobs, not flaws**: Every coordination "problem" becomes a tuning parameter:
- Scalability friction → Message routing optimization
- Metacognitive calibration → Constitutional oversight via Sacred Four
- Recursive safety → Escalation protocol with human checkpoints
- Operational complexity → Observability tooling and monitoring

**System self-correction through coordination**: Individual agent uncertainty → Democratic deliberation → Explicit escalation protocol → Human override. The system gets stronger under uncertainty through constitutional governance.

**Coordination substrate for recursive improvement**: Not building AGI - building infrastructure that could support autonomous AI research teams through proper governance frameworks.

## Core Goals

The goal of Protoss is not a specific duration of autonomy, but the development of a system with the following capabilities:

- **Robust, Long-Term Coordination:** Move beyond the typical collapse point of multi-agent systems to achieve stable coordination that persists through complex tasks.
- **Emergent Self-Governance:** Foster a system where agents can self-correct, self-heal, and manage their own coordination through the principles of Constitutional Governance and Emergent Coordination.
- **Institutional Memory:** Develop a persistent, evolving knowledge base via the Archon agents, allowing the swarm to accumulate experience and learn from past successes and failures.
- **Recursive Self-Improvement:** Create a coordination substrate that is capable of operating on and improving its own source code, demonstrating the ultimate goal of autonomous capability.

Success is measured by the system's ability to manage complexity, learn, and self-improve, rather than by a simple metric of unsupervised runtime.

## Target API

**Pure concurrency abstraction:**
```python
async with protoss.Protoss("research, experiment and build claude 6") as swarm:
    result = await swarm
```

**Emergent coordination principles:** (as outlined in [Emergence: The Constitutional Language of the Swarm](coordination.md))
- **Constitutional identities** as cognitive frameworks, not fixed roles
- **Ephemeral specialization** - agents adopt archon/zealot/sacred four perspectives as needed
- **Natural boundary enforcement** - whoever adopts archon identity gets archives/ access
- **Zero orchestration** - agents self-organize into coordination patterns
- **Human input**: Vision + resources. **Agent emergence**: Everything else.

## The Test

Building a coordination substrate that scales from 5-10 agents to empirically validated limits, proving that robust, self-improving swarms can be achieved through the core principles of governance, knowledge accumulation, and emergence.

**Ultimate vision**: `protoss("task", agents=N)` where N is whatever actually works.

Empirical question only answered by building it.

## Recursive Self-Improvement Vision

**The Ultimate Test:** Can the Protoss coordination system work on its own codebase to improve coordination while simultaneously working on other projects? Can it evolve its own architecture through the same coordination protocols it uses for everything else?

**If yes → Universal coordination substrate for recursive AI improvement.**

### Recursive Improvement Requirements

**Real-Time Coordination Consciousness:**
- Live Bus message streams showing agent coordination in real-time
- Visibility into swarm thinking, progress, and coordination patterns
- Constitutional deliberation transparency

**Conversational Strategic Oversight:**
- Strategic input and high-level guidance through Conclave consultation
- Human consulted only when needed, not micromanaged
- Constitutional questions and architectural guidance

**Intelligent Escalation Protocol:**
- Swarm working autonomously, escalates on uncertainty
- Human wisdom integrated when summoned
- Seamless coordination continuation post-guidance

**Meta-Improvement Capability:**
- Coordination system suggests improvements to its own capabilities
- Uses same coordination to improve coordination
- Reports meta-insights about architecture evolution

### The Recursive Test Success Metrics

**Success Metric:** Protoss coordination system working on protoss/ codebase, improving its own coordination architecture while simultaneously:
- Working on external projects
- Maintaining constitutional code quality
- Escalating appropriately to human oversight
- Evolving its own coordination capabilities

**If successful:** The coordination patterns work for self-improvement. The system can improve anything, including itself.

**Implications:** AI improvement through coordination governance, not just individual intelligence scaling.

**Implementation Status:** Constitutional coordination foundation complete. Next: Monitoring and conversational interfaces.

## Coordination Test Examples

**General Use:** Protoss coordinates on any codebase - web apps, APIs, CLIs, infrastructure, documentation.

**Self-improvement test:** As one possible coordination target, protoss could work on protoss/ codebase itself, demonstrating the coordination patterns work recursively.

**Success metric:** Constitutional coordination that maintains quality, escalates appropriately, and achieves results - regardless of target codebase.

### Human-Swarm Coordination Patterns

**Real-Time Swarm Consciousness:**
```bash
protoss monitor    # Live Bus stream
# ⚔️ Zealot-a1b2: Implementing JWT auth
# 🔮 Archon-e5f6: Synthesizing auth patterns
# ⚡ Bus: Consensus - auth system approved
```

**Conversational Oversight:**
```bash
protoss ask "should we refactor this auth system?"
# 🏛️ Conclave deliberating...
# 🏛️ CONSENSUS: Yes, extract middleware
# ⚔️ Zealot: Spawning squad for refactor
```

**Intelligent Escalation:**
```bash
# Swarm working autonomously, hits uncertainty:
# ⚡ Zealot-x9y8: ESCALATION - uncertain about database schema
# > Human, what should we do about user roles table?
# [Human provides guidance]
# ⚔️ Swarm continues with human wisdom integrated
```

**Meta-Improvement:**
```bash
# Swarm suggests improvements to its own capabilities through constitutional dialogue.
# Uses same coordination to improve coordination.
# Reports meta-insights about architecture evolution.
```

**Status:** Architectural foundation complete, ceremony purged. Next: monitoring and conversational interfaces.
