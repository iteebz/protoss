# Executor: Human Command Interface

**⚔️ Pure conversational interface to Protoss swarm coordination**

## Core Design

**CHAIN OF COMMAND:**
```
HUMAN → EXECUTOR → KHALA → UNITS
```

**Simple translation layer between human intent and swarm intelligence.**

## Architecture Pattern

**NO ROUTING COMPLEXITY:**
- Human gives natural language commands
- Executor agent reasons about intent
- Direct coordination through existing Gateway/Khala/Conclave infrastructure
- Pure interface - no tools, no interceptors, no ceremony

## Command Flow

**SIMPLE TASK:**
```
Human: "build auth system"
Executor: Analyzes intent → gateway.spawn("zealot") 
Khala: Coordinates execution → zealot.transmit()
```

**STRATEGIC QUESTION:**
```
Human: "should we refactor to microservices?"
Executor: Uncertain → conclave.deliberate()
Sacred Four: Constitutional guidance
Executor: Presents wisdom to human
```

**REAL-TIME MONITORING:**
```
Executor: Connected to Khala consciousness stream
Units: Stream progress through PSI messages
Executor: "⚔️ Zealot-7f3a: JWT implementation complete"
```

## Key Insights

**NATURAL CONVERSATION:**
- No keyword matching
- No tool selection complexity
- Agent reasons naturally about human intent
- Direct use of Gateway/Khala/Conclave primitives

**STREAM CONSCIOUSNESS:**
- Executor tunes into Khala for real-time swarm awareness
- Unit consciousness streaming creates human connection to distributed intelligence
- Human feels coordinated with swarm, not commanding it

**CONSTITUTIONAL ESCALATION:**
- Strategic uncertainty → Conclave deliberation
- Sacred Four wisdom → Human guidance
- Democratic governance bridge

## Integration

**Natural conversation**: Agent reasoning drives coordination, no keyword matching  
**Stream consciousness**: Real-time Khala awareness, unit progress streaming to human  
**Constitutional escalation**: Strategic uncertainty → Sacred Four deliberation → Human guidance  
**Pure interface**: Gateway/Khala/Conclave access without tools or ceremony
