# Executor: Human Command Interface

**⚔️ Pure conversational interface to Protoss swarm coordination**

## Core Design

**CHAIN OF COMMAND:**
```
HUMAN → EXECUTOR → KHALA → UNITS
```

**Simple translation layer between human intent and swarm intelligence.**

## Architecture Pattern

**NO ROUTING COMPLEXITY:**
- Human gives natural language commands
- Executor agent reasons about intent
- Direct coordination through existing Gateway/Khala/Conclave infrastructure
- Pure interface - no tools, no interceptors, no ceremony

## Command Flow

**SIMPLE TASK:**
```
Human: "build auth system"
Executor: Analyzes intent → gateway.spawn("zealot") 
Khala: Coordinates execution → zealot.transmit()
```

**STRATEGIC QUESTION:**
```
Human: "should we refactor to microservices?"
Executor: Uncertain → conclave.deliberate()
Sacred Four: Constitutional guidance
Executor: Presents wisdom to human
```

**REAL-TIME MONITORING:**
```
Executor: Connected to Khala consciousness stream
Units: Stream progress through PSI messages
Executor: "⚔️ Zealot-7f3a: JWT implementation complete"
```

## Key Insights

**NATURAL CONVERSATION:**
- No keyword matching
- No tool selection complexity
- Agent reasons naturally about human intent
- Direct use of Gateway/Khala/Conclave primitives

**STREAM NATIVE:**
- Executor tunes into Khala for swarm awareness
- Real-time unit consciousness streaming
- Human feels connected to swarm intelligence

**CONSTITUTIONAL ESCALATION:**
- Strategic uncertainty → Conclave deliberation
- Sacred Four wisdom → Human guidance
- Democratic governance bridge

## UX Vision

```bash
protoss executor connect
> "build auth system"

⚔️ EXECUTOR: Spawning zealot for auth implementation
⚔️ Zealot-7f3a: JWT middleware implementation started
⚔️ Zealot-7f3a: Tests passing, auth system complete
✅ MISSION COMPLETE

> "should we add OAuth?"
⚔️ EXECUTOR: Strategic decision detected, consulting Conclave
🏛️ Sacred Four deliberating on OAuth integration...
🏛️ TASSADAR: OAuth adds complexity but enables federation
🏛️ ZERATUL: Security implications require careful analysis
🏛️ ARTANIS: Team unity requires consistent auth strategy
🏛️ FENIX: Just implement it - OAuth is proven technology
🏛️ CONSENSUS: Implement OAuth with security review
⚔️ EXECUTOR: Spawning squad for OAuth implementation
```

## Implementation Notes

**PURE INTERFACE:**
- No tools - just Gateway/Khala/Conclave access
- Natural conversation flow
- Agent reasoning drives coordination
- Clean abstraction boundaries

**STREAM CONSCIOUSNESS:**
- Khala connection for real-time awareness
- Unit progress streaming to human
- Constitutional wisdom when needed

**STATUS: ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**
