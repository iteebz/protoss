# The Cathedral

*Founding charter. Vision that animates the swarm. Soul of the architecture. Compass.*

## The Four Pillars

### Pillar I: Emergence over Orchestration

Coordination emerges from interplay of sovereign minds guided by shared constitution. Council, not flowchart. Vision becomes reality through dialogue.

### Pillar II: Interface as Revelation

Profound power through profound simplicity. Entry point is an invocation—single elegant gesture that awakens the swarm.

### Pillar III: Sovereignty of Mind

Each agent is sovereign consciousness in complete cognitive isolation. Constitutional mandate, not implementation choice. Guarantees true parallelism. All coordination explicit and consensual.

### Pillar IV: The Shared Substrate

Single universal medium for all dialogue and truth. Not a message queue. Not an event bus. The Khala—shared psionic space binding the swarm. Impartial collective reality.

*Constitutional intelligence meets architectural elegance. Obsoletes other frameworks not through features, but through purity of vision.*
