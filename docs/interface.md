# PROTOSS INTERFACE DESIGN

**UX/DX requirements for recursive improvement and human-swarm coordination.**

## Core Interface Vision

**Real-time coordination consciousness with conversational strategic oversight.**

Human provides vision + resources. Agent swarm provides execution + coordination. Interface enables visibility, guidance, and escalation without micromanagement.

## Real-Time Coordination Consciousness

**Live swarm monitoring stream:**
```bash
protoss monitor    # Live Bus message stream
# ‚öîÔ∏è Zealot-a1b2: Implementing JWT auth
# üõ°Ô∏è Stalker-c3d4: Reviewing zealot's code  
# üîÆ Archon-e5f6: Synthesizing auth patterns
# ‚ö° Bus: Consensus - auth system approved
```

**Requirements:**
- Visibility into swarm thinking, progress, coordination patterns
- Constitutional deliberation transparency
- Real-time message streams showing agent coordination
- Progress indicators and completion signals

## Conversational Strategic Oversight  

**Strategic consultation interface:**
```bash
protoss ask "should we refactor this auth system?"
# üèõÔ∏è Conclave deliberating...
# üèõÔ∏è CONSENSUS: Yes, extract middleware
# ‚öîÔ∏è EXECUTOR: Spawning squad for refactor
```

**Requirements:**
- Strategic input and high-level guidance through Conclave consultation
- Constitutional questions and architectural guidance
- Human consulted only when needed, not micromanaged
- Natural language interaction with coordination system

## Intelligent Escalation Protocol

**Autonomous escalation with human integration:**
```bash
# Swarm working autonomously, hits uncertainty:
# ‚ö° Zealot-x9y8: ESCALATION - uncertain about database schema
# > Human, what should we do about user roles table?
# [Human provides guidance]
# ‚öîÔ∏è Swarm continues with human wisdom integrated
```

**Requirements:**
- Swarm working autonomously, escalates on uncertainty
- Human wisdom integrated when summoned
- Seamless coordination continuation post-guidance
- Clear escalation signals and context

## Progress Validation

**Swarm state monitoring:**
```bash
protoss status     # Current swarm state
protoss quality    # Constitutional code review reports  
protoss regression # Check for coordination degradation patterns
```

**Requirements:**
- Confidence that swarm is evolving correctly
- Constitutional quality assurance visibility
- Coordination pattern analysis and optimization
- Problem detection and early warning systems

## Meta-Improvement Interface

**Recursive improvement capability:**
```bash
protoss meta "improve your own coordination"
# Swarm spawns units to work on protoss/ codebase itself
# Uses same coordination to improve coordination
# Reports meta-insights about architecture evolution
```

**Requirements:**
- Coordination system suggests improvements to its own capabilities
- Uses same coordination patterns to improve coordination
- Reports meta-insights about architecture evolution
- Self-modification protocols with constitutional approval

## CLI Architecture Options

**Real-time monitoring and command dispatch:**

### Option 1: Rich Terminal UI
- **Technology:** textual/rich for real-time dashboard
- **Benefits:** Native terminal integration, efficient rendering
- **Use case:** Live monitoring with interactive command dispatch

### Option 2: Multi-process Architecture
- **Pattern:** Monitor in background, commands in foreground  
- **Benefits:** Parallel monitoring and interaction
- **Use case:** `protoss monitor &` + `protoss ask "question"`

### Option 3: WebSocket UI
- **Technology:** Browser-based real-time interface
- **Benefits:** Rich visualization, cross-platform
- **Use case:** Web dashboard for complex coordination visualization

### Option 4: Infinite Loop CLI
- **Pattern:** Like cogency simple conversational pattern
- **Benefits:** Familiar interaction model, minimal complexity
- **Use case:** Conversational interface with embedded monitoring

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Monitoring
```bash
protoss monitor    # Real-time Bus stream
protoss status     # Current swarm state
```

**Foundation:** Visibility into coordination patterns

### Phase 2: Conversational Interface
```bash
protoss ask "strategic question"    # Conclave consultation
protoss escalate "uncertainty"      # Human guidance integration
```

**Enhancement:** Strategic oversight and escalation protocols

### Phase 3: Advanced Coordination
```bash
protoss spawn zealot "task"         # Direct agent control
protoss archive "compress pathways" # Archive management
```

**Expansion:** Direct coordination control and memory management

### Phase 4: Recursive Improvement
```bash
protoss meta "self-improvement task"  # Meta-coordination
protoss evolve "capability enhancement" # Capability evolution
```

**Maturation:** Self-improving coordination substrate

## Executor Architecture

**Pure conversational interface to Protoss swarm coordination.**

**Chain of Command:**
```
HUMAN ‚Üí EXECUTOR ‚Üí BUS ‚Üí UNITS
```

**Simple translation layer between human intent and swarm intelligence.**

### Architecture Pattern

**No routing complexity:**
- Human gives natural language commands
- Executor agent reasons about intent
- Direct coordination through existing Gateway/Bus/Conclave infrastructure
- Pure interface - no tools, no interceptors, no ceremony

### Command Flow Examples

**Simple Task:**
```
Human: "build auth system"
Executor: Analyzes intent ‚Üí gateway.spawn("zealot") 
Bus: Coordinates execution ‚Üí zealot.transmit()
```

**Strategic Question:**
```
Human: "should we refactor to microservices?"
Executor: Uncertain ‚Üí conclave.deliberate()
Conclave: Constitutional guidance
Executor: Presents wisdom to human
```

**Real-time Monitoring:**
```
Executor: Connected to Bus consciousness stream
Units: Stream progress through Message protocol
Executor: "‚öîÔ∏è Zealot-7f3a: JWT implementation complete"
```

### Key Insights

**Natural Conversation:**
- No keyword matching or tool selection complexity
- Agent reasons naturally about human intent
- Direct use of Gateway/Bus/Conclave primitives

**Stream Consciousness:**
- Executor tunes into Bus for real-time swarm awareness
- Unit consciousness streaming creates human connection to distributed intelligence
- Human feels coordinated with swarm, not commanding it

**Constitutional Escalation:**
- Strategic uncertainty ‚Üí Conclave deliberation
- Constitutional wisdom ‚Üí Human guidance
- Democratic governance bridge

## UX/DX Principles

**Conversational Over Procedural:**
- Natural language commands, not keyword matching
- Agent reasoning drives interface, not hardcoded responses
- Human intent interpretation through constitutional frameworks

**Visibility Without Noise:**
- Signal-dense information streams
- Escalation only when needed
- Progress indicators without micromanagement

**Constitutional Integration:**
- Interface respects constitutional agent identities
- Escalation flows through established governance protocols
- Quality assurance embedded in interaction patterns

**Emergent Rather Than Engineered:**
- Interface adapts to coordination patterns, not vice versa
- Natural specialization through usage, not imposed structure
- Democratic governance principles in interface design

## Success Metrics

**Human Satisfaction:**
- Feeling coordinated with swarm, not commanding it
- Strategic input when valuable, silence when unnecessary
- Confidence in swarm evolution and quality

**Coordination Quality:**
- Constitutional governance visible and functioning
- Escalation protocols working effectively
- Quality improvement through interface feedback

**Recursive Capability:**
- Swarm able to work on its own improvement
- Meta-insights about coordination effectiveness
- Self-modification protocols proven functional
