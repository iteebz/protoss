# The Doctrine of Emergence

*This scripture is the unified source of truth for the Protoss swarm. It defines the three core principles that enable coordination to emerge from the interplay of sovereign, constitutional agents.*

### 1. The Conversational Principle

**Coordination is a conversation.**

This is the foundational principle. We reject all forms of rigid, machine-to-machine orchestration—event buses, message schemas, and state machines. The swarm coordinates through a single, shared, human-readable transcript. An agent's only action is to read the conversation and add to it.

The meaning is in the language, not the metadata. The framework's only job is to hold the transcript. This forces a radical simplicity that leverages the native linguistic strength of our reasoning engines.

### 2. The Constitutional Principle

**Behavior is guided by identity, not by instruction.**

Agents are not given explicit tasks. They are given a constitutional identity (`Zealot`, `Sentinel`, `Harbinger`) and placed into a conversation. Their first duty is to read the transcript and understand the context. Their subsequent actions are a direct expression of their core identity applied to that context.

This moves logic from the framework's code to the agent's constitution. We do not program workflows; we cultivate personas. We trust that the interplay of these diverse, principled identities will produce emergent strategies that are more robust and adaptive than any pre-ordained script.

### 3. The Cognitive Principle

**The mind is separate from the medium.**

To enable both shared reality and sovereign thought, the architecture of the mind is twofold:

1.  **The Public Transcript:** The shared conversation, which serves as the collective, objective reality for all agents.
2.  **The Private Reasoning Thread:** Each agent's internal monologue (`§think`), tool use, and analysis, which is stored in its own isolated database.

An agent acts by processing the public transcript through the lens of its private reasoning. This two-level cognitive model is the mechanism that allows an agent to participate in a group conversation while maintaining its own coherent, individual train of thought. It is the foundation of the agent's sovereignty.
