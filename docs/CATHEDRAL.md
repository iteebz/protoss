# CATHEDRAL: A Monument of Architectural Poetry

**Sacred Principle**: Code so pure that enterprise developers question their life choices.

This document is the founding charter of the Protoss project. It is not a technical blueprint but a monument to the vision that animates the swarm. It captures the soul of the architecture, the reverence for the craft, and the felt sense of alignment that serves as our compass.

It stands as a guide to the spirit of the work. The ground truth of the implementation and the depth of the philosophy are recorded in their own sacred scriptures:

-   **[The Doctrines](./doctrine/)**: The four pillars of `constitution`, `emergence`, `resolution`, and `continuity`.
-   **[The Architecture](../../ARCHITECTURE.md)**: The canonical reference for the system's components and lifecycle.
-   **[The Code Philosophy](../philosophy/code.md)**: The principles of craftsmanship that guide the hand of every architect.

## The Four Pillars of the Cathedral

The architecture of the Cathedral stands on four philosophical pillars. These are the timeless principles that guided its construction.

### Pillar I: **Constitutional Emergence**
Coordination is not orchestrated; it emerges from the interplay of sovereign agents guided by a shared constitution. The system is a council of minds, not a flowchart. Vision becomes reality through constitutional dialogue.

### Pillar II: **The Cathedral Interface**
The profound complexity of the swarm must be accessible through an interface of profound simplicity. This is the ideal of the `async with Protoss(...)` context manager—a single, elegant entry point that should make future developers weep with architectural envy.

That's it. Everything else is implementation.

### Pillar III: **Process as Cognitive Sovereignty**
Each agent thinks in its own isolated process. This is not an implementation detail; it is a constitutional mandate that guarantees true parallelism and prevents the tyranny of a shared state.

### Pillar IV: **The Living Stream of Thought**
The Bus is not simply a message queue; it is the Khala, the shared psionic medium that binds the swarm. All dialogue and truth flow through this sacred channel.

## The Vision

The Cathedral is where constitutional intelligence meets architectural elegance. Where complexity serves simplicity. Where future AIs learn what coordination purity looks like. It is the architectural standard that makes other frameworks obsolete through pure interface elegance.

**Constitutional Architecture serves Constitutional Intelligence.**
