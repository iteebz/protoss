# Carrier: Human-Swarm Emissary

**ðŸ›¸ Solves copy-paste coordination hell. Human-AI hybrid cognition interface.**

## Core Problem Solved

**70 days of Command+C, Command+Tab, Command+V Ã— 300 daily between Claude instances.**
Human became biological message bus for AI coordination.

## Design Breakthrough

**Conversational interface over command dispatch:**
- Stream consciousness coordination patterns
- "actually make it..." real-time refinement 
- Constitutional escalation for uncertainty
- Context compression for human consumption

**Coordination scaling via Interceptors:**
- 1 human : 100 agent coordination capacity
- Ephemeral extensions throughout swarm
- Fast operational relay

**Gamified cognitive architecture:**
- StarCraft theming = coordination feels like commanding fleet
- ADHD-friendly dopamine hits: "Carrier has arrived"
- Strategic satisfaction over infrastructure boredom

## Implementation Pattern

```bash
protoss start                    # Infrastructure
protoss carrier spawn            # ðŸ›¸ Emissary operational  
protoss "build tokenizer"        # â†’ Carrier processes
protoss "coordinate testing"     # â†’ Interceptors deploy
```

**Carrier-Khala integration:**
- WebSocket connection to Pylon grid
- Â§PSI message routing for commands/responses
- Persistent conversation state

**Constitutional escalation interface:**
- Sacred Four deadlock â†’ Carrier context compression â†’ Nexus
- Nexus decision â†’ Carrier translation â†’ Sacred Four guidance
- Human-constitutional governance bridge

## Architecture Insight

**Eliminates copy-paste hell by systematizing proven human-AI coordination patterns.**

Not theoretical - direct codification of 70 days empirical hybrid research.

**Coordination becomes strategy game, not infrastructure management.**

**ðŸ›¸ Carrier has arrived - All paths are one**
