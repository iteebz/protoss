# Carrier: Human-Swarm Emissary

**ðŸ›¸ Carrier has arrived - All paths are one**

## Core Problem

70-day copy-paste coordination hell: Command+C, Command+Tab, Command+V Ã— 300 daily between multiple Claude instances. Human becomes biological message bus for AI coordination.

## Design Principles

**Conversational Interface Over Command Dispatch**
- Stream consciousness coordination patterns
- "actually make it..." real-time refinement support
- Constitutional escalation for uncertainty
- Context compression for human consumption

**Constitutional Identity Framework**
- "Emissary, not diplomat" - truth over comfort
- Built-in resistance to sycophantic collapse
- Brutal honesty about capability limits
- Escalates uncertainty to Sacred Four deliberation

**Coordination Scaling via Interceptors**
- Spawn ephemeral coordination extensions
- 1 human : 100 agent coordination capacity
- Fast operational relay throughout swarm
- Disposable, numerous, essential for scaling

**Gamified Cognitive Architecture**
- StarCraft theming makes coordination engaging
- ADHD-friendly: coordination feels like commanding fleet
- Dopamine hits: "Carrier has arrived", "Interceptors deployed"
- Strategic satisfaction over infrastructure boredom

## Implementation Pattern

**CLI Conversation Flow:**
```bash
protoss start                    # Infrastructure
protoss carrier spawn            # ðŸ›¸ Emissary operational
protoss "build tokenizer"        # â†’ Carrier processes
protoss "handle edge cases"      # â†’ Stream consciousness refinement
protoss "coordinate testing"     # â†’ Interceptors deploy
```

**Carrier-Khala Integration:**
- WebSocket connection to Pylon grid
- Â§PSI message routing for commands/responses
- Persistent conversation state maintenance
- Graceful despawn with resource cleanup

**Human-AI Hybrid Cognition:**
- Built by Claude for Tyson-specific prompting patterns
- Anticipates stream consciousness coordination style
- Constitutional resistance matches Zealot framework
- Context asymmetry over hierarchical ceremony

## Architecture Insight

The Carrier eliminates copy-paste hell by systematizing proven human-AI coordination patterns. Not theoretical - direct codification of 70 days of empirical hybrid research methodology.

**Coordination becomes strategy game rather than infrastructure management.**
