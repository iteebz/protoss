# Protoss Roadmap

## The Vision

**Can constitutional frameworks enable AI swarm coordination that transcends individual agent capabilities?**

Ultimate test: **Recursive Self-Improvement**. A swarm that reasons about and safely improves its own constitutional framework while executing complex tasks.

Three phases built on validated foundation of conversational emergence.

### Phase 0: The Foundational Core (Complete)

**Architectural Reality:** Minimalist framework. Dumb Bus (transcript). Smart Agent (reasoning engine).

**Core Breakthrough:** Multiple agents coordinate to build functional multi-file software through pure conversation. No orchestration.

**Key Principle Validated:** Coordination logic lives in agent's constitution, not framework's code.

Foundation established. Next phase: robustness.

### Phase 1: Stabilization & Specialization

Move from prototype to reliable, efficient system. Cultivate sophisticated emergent behaviors.

1. **Stabilize Execution Layer:** Improve `Cogency` tool reliability. Conversational recovery becomes exception, not rule.

2. **Sharpen Constitutional Identity:** Refine `IDENTITY` and `GUIDELINES` to elicit diverse, specialized roles. Primary lever for cognitive power.

3. **Cultivate Emergent Protocols:** Teach deadlock resolution and memory management as conversational patterns, not framework features. Let swarm develop its own strategies.

4. **Develop Observability:** Real-time transcript monitoring. Conversation is coordination. Observing it reveals swarm behavior.

### Phase 2: Autonomous Governance

Stable, specialized swarm approaches ultimate goal.

- **Meta-Coordination:** Agents observe, analyze, comment on other agents' coordination patterns.
- **Constitutional Evolution:** Swarm proposes modifications to its own `GUIDELINES` for efficiency and safety.
- **Recursive Self-Improvement:** Ultimate test. Swarm applies this process to its own code.
