# Constitutional Safety Architecture

## Current Reality: Phase 0
**Protoss is currently human orchestration with constitutional themes, not genuine emergence.**

- Human-controlled spawning, termination, mission parameters
- Constitutional documents are guidance, not autonomous governance
- This is orchestration with constitutional aesthetics

## Layered Safety
1. **Base Model Safety**: LLM provider constraints (immutable backstop)
2. **Constitutional Framework**: Protoss protocols (evolvable at checkpoints) 
3. **Agent Identity**: Self-modifying within constitutional bounds

## Phase Evolution

### Phase 0: Human Orchestration (Current)
Human control with constitutional guidance

### Phase 1: Bounded Constitutional Evolution
- Constitutional changes only at defined checkpoints
- Human review required for all constitutional modifications
- Drift monitoring between checkpoints
- Constitution/ folder protection when swarms self-modify

### Phase 2: Autonomous Constitutional Governance
- Self-governed emergence under immutable constitutional invariants
- Internal enforcement through constitutional kernel
- Human authority over swarm lifecycle, not moment-to-moment control

## Constitutional Evolution Protocol
1. Agents propose amendments through dialogue
2. Human review of proposed changes
3. Automated invariant verification
4. Version control and signatures
5. Post-implementation drift monitoring

## Emergency Protocols
- `!emergency`: Immediate swarm halt (cannot be overridden)
- `@arbiter`: Natural language intervention requests

## Risk Boundaries
**Acceptable**: Constitutional evolution within bounded parameters, agent self-modification within constitutional constraints

**Prohibited**: Unilateral constitutional self-modification, circumvention of emergency halt, value drift beyond invariants

**We pursue bounded sovereignty, not absolute autonomy.**
