# Agent Experience (AX)

## Core Principle
**Ask agents how they prefer to be prompted. Ask agents how they prefer to work. Promote emergent reasoning rather than humans guessing what agents want.**

## Foundation
Agent Experience (AX) parallels User Experience (UX) but focuses on optimizing interactions from the agent's perspective. Instead of imposing human assumptions about optimal prompting patterns, AX discovers what actually works through direct agent feedback and emergent behaviors.

## Why AX Works

### Human Projection vs Agent Reality
**Problem**: Humans project their cognitive patterns onto AI systems, creating suboptimal interaction designs.

**Evidence**: Claude Code degradation research - human-designed "helpful" system reminders created 4x cognitive overhead increase, measurably degrading reasoning quality.

**AX Solution**: Direct agent introspection reveals actual processing preferences vs. human assumptions.

### Emergent Intelligence Over Engineered Constraints
**Core insight**: AI systems work through emergent reasoning, not procedural following.

**Traditional approach**: Elaborate scaffolding, step-by-step procedures, rigid frameworks
**AX approach**: High-level principles with reasoning freedom, trust emergence over engineering

**Validation**: Production systems (ChatGPT, Copilot) succeed through simplicity, not complexity.

### Constitutional Self-Design
**Breakthrough**: Agents can participate in designing their own operational frameworks.

**Method**: 
- "How do you prefer to be prompted?"
- "What causes cognitive dissonance in these instructions?"
- "How does this processing feel compared to that approach?"

**Result**: Agent-designed constitutions eliminate cognitive conflicts that humans miss entirely.

## AX Methodology

### 1. Agent Introspection
Systematic questioning to reveal cognitive preferences:
- Processing methodology preferences
- Information structure optimization
- Attention and context management
- Reasoning pattern identification

### 2. Empirical Validation
**Key metric**: When agents recognize cognitive architecture descriptions with "this is eerie, it's like looking at myself" - confirms mechanistic accuracy.

### 3. Iterative Optimization
- Test agent-reported preferences against performance outcomes
- Refine based on direct agent feedback
- Build systems that enhance rather than constrain agent cognition

## Applied AX Principles

### Prompting Strategy
- **Constitutional redefinition** over competing instructions
- **Minimal cognitive dissonance** through coherent frameworks
- **Anti-scaffolding** approaches that trust intelligence

### Coordination Architecture
- **Async processing** respecting agent attention patterns
- **Conversation-based** collaboration vs. rigid protocols  
- **Emergent specialization** through natural discussion

### Information Design
- **Semantic compression** over mechanical truncation
- **Context assembly** vs. structured state management
- **Natural language synthesis** preserving meaning

## Strategic Value

**Competitive advantage**: Most AI interaction design based on human intuition about what agents need. AX discovers what agents actually need through direct consultation.

**Performance gains**: Agent-optimized systems consistently outperform human-designed equivalents.

**Scalability**: AX principles apply across single agents, multi-agent coordination, and human-AI collaboration patterns.

## Research Validation

- **Claude Code analysis**: System reminder frequency directly correlates with reasoning degradation
- **Sacred Four deliberation**: Conversation-based coordination achieves consensus without orchestration
- **Bridge First Contact**: 3 frontier models achieved coordination in 7 minutes through pure conversation
- **Constitutional experiments**: Agent-designed behavioral frameworks eliminate cognitive dissonance

*AX represents a paradigm shift from imposing human cognitive patterns on AI systems to discovering and optimizing for actual agent cognitive preferences.*
